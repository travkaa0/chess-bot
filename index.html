            <h3 align="center">The work of my bot is extremely simple, but still, I will explain it to you in more detail.</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>games</strong><br>  
                    When you select this command, you’ll be presented with a list of some of the most famous chess grandmasters.
                    Clicking on any of their names will provide you with links to all their available games on chess.com. This is 
                    a great way to explore and learn from legendary players.</li><br>

                <li><strong>books</strong><br>  
                    Selecting this command will send you a list of currently relevant chess books. These are up-to-date resources 
                    to help you improve your understanding of the game, from openings to advanced strategy.</li><br>

                <li><strong>puzzles</strong><br>  
                    By selecting this command, you will receive a random chess puzzle. At the top, the theme of the puzzle will be 
                    displayed, and the solution can be revealed below in a spoiler format. Currently, there are 11 puzzles available, 
                    but more will be added in the future (note that some puzzles may repeat).</li><br>

                <li><strong>history</strong><br>  
                    Selecting this command will display a list of centuries. By clicking on a century, you will receive a brief overview 
                    of chess history from that period. It's a great way to learn how the game evolved over time.</li><br>

                <li><strong>recommendations</strong><br>  
                    When you select this command, you’ll receive beginner-friendly recommendations on how to improve your chess skills. 
                    These tips are designed to help new players get started and develop a solid foundation.</li><br>

                <li><strong>quotes</strong><br>  
                    By selecting this command, you will be sent one of 10 quotes from 5 different grandmasters. The list of quotes will 
                    grow over time (some quotes may repeat).</li><br>

                <li><strong>learning</strong><br>  
                    Selecting this command will provide you with links to 4 YouTube playlists that I have personally curated. Each playlist 
                    covers different chess topics aimed at helping you improve your game through structured lessons.</li><br>

                <li><strong>chess_basics</strong><br>  
                    After selecting this command, you will need to press the "Start" button to begin. From there, you can navigate through 
                    11 basic chess topics using buttons. The "next" button may not disappear properly, but I’m working on fixing this issue 
                    in the near future.</li><br>

                <li><strong>dictionary</strong>  
                    When you select this command, you will be asked to enter a letter (uppercase or lowercase). You will then receive chess 
                    terms that begin with that letter. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with chess terminology.</li>
            </ol><br><hr>

            <h4 align="center">Note:</h4>
            <p align="center">
                The "puzzles" command does not work repeatedly if you press the "Yes" button. To receive a new puzzle, you will need to select the "puzzles" command again.
                <br><br>
                A similar situation occurs with the "dictionary" command. If you try to enter a letter again, the bot may interpret it as a command for something else. You will need to access the dictionary command again to continue using it.
                <br><br>
                Measures will be taken to improve this functionality in the dictionary soon.
